                    <p>CSS Grid Layout excels at dividing a page into major regions or defining the relationship in terms
                        of size, position, and layer, between parts of a control built from HTML primitives.A grid is an
                        intersecting set of horizontal and vertical lines, one set defining columns and the other rows. Elements
                        can be placed onto the grid, respecting these column and row lines. Grid is the very first CSS module
                        created specifically to solve the layout problems we've all been hacking our way around for as long
                        as we've been making websites. CSS grid layout has differents features like create a grid with fixed
                        track sizes using pixels (absolute measure), or using (relative measure) percentages or fr unit.
                        Also you can place items into a precise location on the grid using line numbers, names or by targeting
                        an area of the grid. Deals with the content added outside of a declared grid, which adds additional
                        rows and columns when needed. We can control how the items align once placed into a grid area, and
                        how the entire grid is aligned. Grid is a powerful specification and when combined with other parts
                        of CSS such as flexbox, can help you to create layouts that were previously impossible to build in
                        CSS.
                    </p>

                    <header id="basics" class="main-section"> * Basics </header>
                    <p>You have to define a container element as a grid with display: grid, set the column and row sizes
                        with grid-template-columns and grid-template-rows, and then place its child elements into the grid
                        with grid-column and grid-row. Similarly to flexbox, the source order of the grid items doesn't matter.
                        Your CSS can place them in any order, which makes it super easy to rearrange your grid with media
                        queries. Imagine defining the layout of your entire page, and then completely rearranging it to accommodate
                        a different screen width all with only a couple lines of CSS. Grid is one of the most powerful CSS
                        modules ever introduced. As of March 2017, most browsers shipped native, unprefixed support for CSS
                        Grid: Chrome (including on Android), Firefox, Safari (including on iOS), and Opera. Internet Explorer
                        10 and 11 on the other hand support it, but it's an old implementation with an outdated syntax. </p>

                    <header id="terminology" class="main-section"> * Important Terminology </header>
                    <p>Before diving into the concepts of Grid it's important to understand the terminology. Since the terms
                        involved here are all kinda conceptually similar, it's easy to confuse them with one another if you
                        don't first memorize their meanings defined by the Grid specification.
                        <ul>
                            <li>Grid Container: The element on which display: grid is applied. It's the direct parent of
                                all the grid items. In this example container is the grid container.</li>
                            <li>Grid Item: The children (e.g. direct descendants) of the grid container. Here the item elements
                                are grid items, but sub-item isn't.</li>
                            <li>Grid Line: The dividing lines that make up the structure of the grid. They can be either
                                vertical ("column grid lines") or horizontal ("row grid lines") and reside on either side
                                of a row or column. Here the yellow line is an example of a column grid line.</li>
                            <li>Grid Track: The space between two adjacent grid lines. You can think of them like the columns
                                or rows of the grid. Here's the grid track between the second and third row grid lines.</li>
                            <li>Grid Cell: The space between two adjacent row and two adjacent column grid lines. It's a
                                single "unit" of the grid. Here's the grid cell between row grid lines 1 and 2, and column
                                grid lines 2 and 3.</li>
                            <li>Grid Area: The total space surrounded by four grid lines. A grid area may be comprised of
                                any number of grid cells. Here's the grid area between row grid lines 1 and 3, and column
                                grid lines 1 and 3.</li>
                        </ul>
                    </p>
                    <header id="grid-container" class="main-section"> * Properties For The Grid Container </header>
                    <p><u>Displays</u> Defines the element as a grid container and establishes a new grid formatting context
                        for its contents. Values:
                        <ul>
                            <li>grid - generates a block-level grid</li>
                            <li>inline-grid - generates an inline-level grid</li>
                        </ul>
                    </p>
                    <p><u>Grid-template-columns / Grid-template-rows</u> Defines the columns and rows of the grid with a
                        space-separated list of values. The values represent the track size, and the space between them represents
                        the grid line. Values:
                        <ul>
                            <li>track-size - can be a length, a percentage, or a fraction of the free space in the grid (using
                                the fr unit)</li>
                            <li>line-name - an arbitrary name of your choosing</li>
                        </ul>
                    </p>
                    <p><u>Grid-template-areas</u> Defines a grid template by referencing the names of the grid areas which
                        are specified with the grid-area property. Repeating the name of a grid area causes the content to
                        span those cells. A period signifies an empty cell. The syntax itself provides a visualization of
                        the structure of the grid. Values:
                        <ul>
                            <li>grid-area-name - the name of a grid area specified with grid-area</li>
                            <li>. - a period signifies an empty</li>
                            <li>grid cell none - no grid areas are defined</li>
                        </ul>
                    </p>
                    <p><u>Grid-column-gap / Grid-row-gap</u> Specifies the size of the grid lines. You can think of it like
                        setting the width of the gutters between the columns/rows. The gutters are only created between the
                        columns/rows, not on the outer edges. Note: The grid- prefix will be removed and grid-column-gap
                        and grid-row-gap renamed to column-gap and row-gap. Values:
                        <ul>
                            <li>line-size - a length value</li>
                        </ul>
                    </p>
                    <p><u>Justify-items</u> Aligns grid items along the inline (row) axis (as opposed to align-items which
                        aligns along the block (column) axis). This value applies to all grid items inside the container.
                        Values:
                        <ul>
                            <li>start - aligns items to be flush with the start edge of their cell</li>
                            <li>end - aligns items to be flush with the end edge of their cell</li>
                            <li>center - aligns items in the center of their cell</li>
                            <li>stretch - fills the whole width of the cell (this is the default)</li>
                        </ul>
                    </p>

                    <p><u>Grid-column-start / Grid-column-end / Grid-row-start / Grid-row-end</u> Determines a grid item's
                        location within the grid by referring to specific grid lines. grid-column-start/grid-row-start is
                        the line where the item begins, and grid-column-end/grid-row-end is the line where the item ends.
                        Values:
                        <ul>
                            <li>line - can be a number to refer to a numbered grid line, or a name to refer to a named grid
                                line span
                            </li>
                            <li>number - the item will span across the provided number of grid tracks span</li>
                            <li>name - the item will span across until it hits the next line with the provided name auto
                                - indicates</li>
                            <li>auto-placement, an automatic span, or a default span of one</li>
                        </ul>
                    </p>
                    <p><u>Grid-column / Grid-row</u> Shorthand for grid-column-start + grid-column-end, and grid-row-start
                        + grid-row-end, respectively. Values:
                        <ul>
                            <li>start-line / end-line - each one accepts all the same values as the longhand version, including
                                span
                            </li>
                        </ul>
                    </p>
                    <p><u>Grid-area</u> Gives an item a name so that it can be referenced by a template created with the
                        grid-template-areas property. Alternatively, this property can be used as an even shorter shorthand
                        for grid-row-start + grid-column-start + grid-row-end + grid-column-end. Values:
                        <ul>
                            <li>name - a name of your choosing</li>
                            <li>row-start / column-start / row-end / column-end - can be numbers or named lines</li>
                        </ul>
                    </p>
                    <p><u>Justify-self</u> Aligns a grid item inside a cell along the inline (row) axis (as opposed to align-self
                        which aligns along the block (column) axis). This value applies to a grid item inside a single cell.
                        Values:
                        <ul>
                            <li>start - aligns the grid item to be flush with the start edge of the cell.</li>
                            <li>end - aligns the grid item to be flush with the end edge of the cell.</li>
                            <li>center - aligns the grid item in the center of the cell.</li>
                            <li>stretch - fills the whole width of the cell (this is the default)</li>
                        </ul>
                    </p>
                    <p><u>Align-self</u> Aligns a grid item inside a cell along the block (column) axis (as opposed to justify-self
                        which aligns along the inline (row) axis). This value applies to the content inside a single grid
                        item. Values:
                        <ul>
                            <li>start - aligns the grid item to be flush with the start edge of the cell.</li>
                            <li>end - aligns the grid item to be flush with the end edge of the cell.</li>
                            <li>center - aligns the grid item in the center of the cell.</li>
                            <li>stretch - fills the whole height of the cell (this is the default)</li>
                        </ul>
                    </p>
                    <p><u>Place-self</u> place-self sets both the align-self and justify-self properties in a single declaration.
                        Values:
                        <ul>
                            <li>auto - The “default” alignment for the layout mode.</li>
                            <li>align-self / justify-self - The first value sets align-self, the second value justify-self.
                                If the second value is omitted, the first value is assigned to both properties.</li>
                        </ul>
